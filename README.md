# number-counter

## Program Description
This program generates a range of numbers based upon a set of parameters given by the user. The three parameters are: a start value, an end value, and a step value. 

The program begins by prompting the user to enter a start value, an end value, and a step value. The only required value is the end value; if the user hits enter without providing a number for the start or step, then the default value of 0 is used as the start and the default value of 1 is used for the step. 

If the user enters an incorrect value (e.g., a string, a negative value) or does not provide a required value, an error message is printed to prompt the user to try again until a correct value is entered. 

Once the values have been entered by the user, the range is printed to the screen.
